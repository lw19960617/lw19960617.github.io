      <description>Meng Haoran
My boat is moored near an isle in mist grey;
I&amp;rsquo;m grieved anew to see the parting day.
On boundless plain trees seem to scrape the sky;
In water clear the moon appears so night.

The sun beyondthe mountain glows;
The Yellow River seawards flow.
You can enjoy a grander sight
By climbing to a greater height.

      <description>Wang Zhihuan
The yellow sand uprises as high as white cloud;
The lonely town is lost amid the mountains proud.
Why should the Mongol flute complain no willows grow?
Beyond the Gate of Jade no vernal wind will blow.

      <description>He Zhizhang
The slender tree is dressed in emerald all about;
Thousands of branches droop like fringes made of jade.
But do you know by whom these slim leaves are cut out?
The wind of early spring is sharp as scissor blade.

      <description>He Zhizhang
Oh, I return to the bornland I left while young,
Thinner has grown my hair , though I speak the same tongue.
My children, whom I meet, do not know who am I.
&amp;ldquo;Where are you from, dear sir?&amp;ldquo;they ask with beaming eyes.
