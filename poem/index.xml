      <description>王昌龄
青海长云暗雪山，
孤城遥望玉门关。
黄沙百战穿金甲，
不破楼兰终不还。
Wang Changling
Clouds on frontier have darkened mountains clad in snow;
The town with Gate of Jade stands far away, forlorn.
We will not leave the desert till we beat the foe,
Although in war our golden armour be outworn.

      <description>Wang Han
With wine of grapes the cups of jade would glow at night;
Drinking to pipa songs, we are summoned to fight.
Don&amp;rsquo;t laugh if we lay drunken on the battleground,
How many warriors ever came back safe and sound?

      <description>Wang Changling
The moon still shines on mountain passes as of yore.
How many guardsmen of Great Wall come back no more!
If the Flying General were still there in command.
No hostile steeds would have dared to invade our land.

      <description>Meng Haoran
My boat is moored near an isle in mist grey;
I&amp;rsquo;m grieved anew to see the parting day.
On boundless plain trees seem to scrape the sky;
In water clear the moon appears so night.

      <description>Wang Zhihuan
The sun beyondthe mountain glows;
The Yellow River seawards flow.
You can enjoy a grander sight
By climbing to a greater height.

      <description>Wang Zhihuan
The yellow sand uprises as high as white cloud;
The lonely town is lost amid the mountains proud.
Why should the Mongol flute complain no willows grow?
Beyond the Gate of Jade no vernal wind will blow.

      <description>He Zhizhang
The slender tree is dressed in emerald all about;
Thousands of branches droop like fringes made of jade.
But do you know by whom these slim leaves are cut out?
The wind of early spring is sharp as scissor blade.

      <description>He Zhizhang
Oh, I return to the bornland I left while young,
Thinner has grown my hair , though I speak the same tongue.
My children, whom I meet, do not know who am I.
&amp;ldquo;Where are you from, dear sir?&amp;ldquo;they ask with beaming eyes.
