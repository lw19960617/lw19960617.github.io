Thousands of branches droop like fringes made of jade.
But do you know by whom these slim leaves are cut out?
The wind of early spring is sharp as scissor blade.</description>

Oh, I return to the bornland I left while young,
Thinner has grown my hair , though I speak the same tongue.
My children, whom I meet, do not know who am I.
&amp;ldquo;Where are you from, dear sir?&amp;ldquo;they ask with beaming eyes.</description>
